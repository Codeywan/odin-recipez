    <p>Baked french bread from scratch</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant or active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, or avocado oil</li>
        <li>5 1/2 - 6 cups all-purpose or bread flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In electric mixer with dough hook, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let mixture bubble (~5 minutes) for yeast to activate.</li>
        <li>Add in the salt, oil, and 3 cups of flour. Mix. Add 2.5 - 3 more cups of flour gradually until the dough clears the side of the bowl. Dough should not leave residue on your fingers when you touch it. Knead for a couple more munites until the dough is smooth. Add a little more dough if it sticks to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl and cover. let rise until doubled (about an hour)</li>
        <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface and divide in half (for two loaves). Pat each section into ~ 9x13 inch rectangles. Roll the dough up hotdog-style. Pinch edges to seal and place seam side down on parchment paper lined baking sheet. Slash gashes into the top of the loaf with a sharp blade.</li>
        <li>Cover with towel and let loaves rise again (about an hour),</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F and make sure rack is in center position.</li>
        <li>Bake each loaf for 25-30 minutes until golden and baked through. Remove from the oven and baste with butter.</li>
        <li>You can also try spreading an egg wash before baking. Who knows?</li>
    </ol>
